##- what is visual python?


Visual Python (VPython) is a 3D graphics module for the Python programming language. 
It was originated by David Scherer in 2000 and is designed to make it easy for users to create navigable 3D displays and animations, even for those with limited programming experience. VPython is an open source project that was started for students who struggle with coding during Python classes for data science. 
It aims to provide a GUI-based Python code generator for Google Colab as an extension.
